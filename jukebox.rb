# Build a Jukebox

# create a file jukebox.rb

# When that program is run, it should introduce itself
# to the user and accept input from the user using the gets command.

# The jukebox should respond to 4 commands, help, play, list and exit.

# The help command should output instructions for the user
# on how to use the jukebox.

# The list command should output a list of songs that the
# user can play.

# the play command should accept a song, either by number/index
# or name. Once the user has indicated which song they want to
# play, the jukebox should output 'Playing The Phoenix - 1901'
# or whatever song name is important.

# if the user types in exit, the jukebox should say goodbye
# and the program should shut down.

# Think about the following things

# How to keep the program running until the exit command is
# executed (Hint: Loop maybe? Loop upon a condition)

# How to normalize the user's input so LIST and list are the
# same. (Hint, maybe downcase and strip it)

# How to give the songs an "index" so that when you list them
# out, you can refer to them by position so the user can just
# type play 1 and then you find the first song. (Hint, check
# out a method called each_with_index)
