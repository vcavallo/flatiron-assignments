# Domain Model for a School

Write a model that stores students along with the grade that they are in.

```ruby
school = School.new("Bayside High School")
```

If no students have been added, the roster should be empty:

	```ruby
	school.roster
	# => {}
	```


When you add a student, they get added to the correct grade.

	```ruby
	school.add_student("Zach Morris", 9)
	school.roster
	# => {9 => ["Zach Morris"]}
	```

You can, of course, add several students to the same grade, and students to different grades.

	```ruby
	school.add_student("AC Slater", 9)
	school.add_student("Kelly Kapowski", 10)
	school.add_student("Screech", 11)
	school.roster
	# => {9 => ["Zach Morris", "AC Slater"], 10 => ["Kelly Kapowski"], 11 => ["Screech"]}
	```

Also, you can ask for all the students in a single grade:

	```ruby
	school.grade(9)
	# => ["Zach Morris", "AC Slater"]
	```

Lastly, you should be able to get a sorted list of all the students. Grades are sorted in descending order numerically, and the students within them are sorted in ascending order alphabetically.

	```ruby
	school.sort
	# => {9 => ["AC Slater", "Zach Morris"], 10 => ["Kelly Kapowski"], 11 => ["Screech"]}
	```
Here's a test suite to help you validate.

	```ruby
	require 'rspec'
	
	describe School do
	  before :each do
	    @school = School.new("Test School")
	  end
	
	  describe "::new" do
	    it 'should have an empty roster when initialized' do
	      @school.roster.length.should eq(0)
	    end
	  end
	
	  describe "#add_student" do
	    it 'should be able to add a student' do
	      @school.add_student("AC Slater", 10)
	      @school.roster.should eq({10 => ["AC Slater"]})
	    end
	
	    it 'be able to add multiple students to a class (grade)' do
	      @school.add_student("Jeff Baird", 10)
	      @school.add_student("Blake Johnson", 10)
	
	      @school.roster.should eq({10 => ["Jeff Baird", "Blake Johnson"]})
	    end
	
	    it 'should be able to add students to different grades' do
	      @school.add_student("Homer Simpson", 9)
	      @school.add_student("Jeff Baird", 10)
	      @school.add_student("Avi Flombaum", 10)
	      @school.add_student("Blake Johnson", 7)
	
	      @school.roster.should eq({9 => ["Homer Simpson"], 10 => ["Jeff Baird", "Avi Flombaum"], 7 => ["Blake Johnson"]})
	    end
	  end
	
	  describe '#grade' do
	    it 'should be able to retreive students from a grade' do
	      @school.add_student("Homer Simpson", 9)
	      @school.add_student("Avi Flombaum", 10)
	      @school.add_student("Jeff Baird", 10)
	      @school.add_student("Blake Johnson", 7)
	
	      @school.grade(10).should eq(["Avi Flombaum", "Jeff Baird"])
	    end
	  end
	
	  describe "#sort" do
	    it 'should be able to sort the students' do
	      @school.add_student("Homer Simpson", 9)
	      @school.add_student("Bart Simpson", 9)
	      @school.add_student("Avi Flombaum", 10)
	      @school.add_student("Jeff Baird", 10)
	      @school.add_student("Blake Johnson", 7)
	      @school.add_student("Jack Bauer", 7)
	
	      @school.sort.should eq({7 => ["Blake Johnson", "Jack Bauer"], 9 => ["Bart Simpson", "Homer Simpson"], 10 => ["Avi Flombaum", "Jeff Baird"]})
	    end
	  end
	end
	```
